# Novasper

https://github.com/novaugust/Novasper

This is a customization of the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), [Casper](http://github.com/tryghost/casper/)).

To download, visit the [releases](https://github.com/novaugust/novasper/releases) page.

## Differences From Casper

### Demo
This blog is always live over at [blog.novaugust.net](http://blog.novaugust.net)

#### Post image

This theme prioritizes photos. On any page with post excerpts (home page, archive page, author page, tag page, etc), the post's image is displayed as a full-width background image behind the post excerpt.

![Post excerpt example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novaugust/Novasper/novasper/screenshots/post-excerpt.png)

The image is again emphasized in the header of the post.

#### Images in posts

Images in posts are blown out to 100% of the user's viewport, without going beyond the image's actual dimensions and stretching.

Vertically oriented images are limited to 150% of the user's viewport's height, meaning they'll require scrolling, but won't be unhandleable

#### Tympanus Post Title Hover Effects

There's a cute animation when you hover over post titles. That's all.

#### Inverted Colors

This theme favors darker backgrounds (hex #222) and so inverts font colors to be readable on it.
