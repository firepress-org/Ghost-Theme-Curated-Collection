# Ghost Theme Curated Collection 


## What is this?

It’s a collection of well curated Ghost themes (*templates if you prefer*) for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Ghost is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It’s individual bloggers as well as online publications. You can see Ghost as a CMS (content management system) designed to be better alternative to systems like: *WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr*, etc.


## Live demo

**Not available** at the moment. I’m working on a dedicated website where people will be able to see all Ghost Themes we are supporting at FirePress.

- [See this theme](#) on your own device.
- Even better! [Login into Ghost Admin Panel](#) and see how this theme looks with your own content. 


## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is… I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
