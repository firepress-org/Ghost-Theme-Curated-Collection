## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme is an enhanced version of the Ghost Theme **Vapor**. If you don’t know [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) it’s great tools to publish your website and your blog.

These are the essential enhancements I can’t live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)

**Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme is one the few themes that pass our big test. See the curated collection [in this Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).

**Compatibility** — This theme will work on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) >= **1.0**.

## Author

In the git world most people refer themselves as maintainers but I hate this expression. It feels heavy. I much prefer author.
