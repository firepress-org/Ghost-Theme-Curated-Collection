## FirePress Klimax

https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax

This theme is under heavy development. 

Our theme **FirePress Klimax** is an enhanced version of the original Casper theme made by the Ghost foundation. The goal is to make a drop-in replacement of the original Casper theme. 

We decided to make it available to everyone and open sourced at: https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax

The **version** number [can be found in the package.json](https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Klimax/blob/master/package.json#L5)

It follows updates (1.3.6 - [double check here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/blob/master/package.json#L5)) has we want to keep best practice and new feature made by the original Casper theme.
