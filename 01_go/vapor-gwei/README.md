# Gwei

https://github.com/robinj/gwei

A minimal theme based on [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor). It shares roughly the same goals in addition to: 
 - Reducing external CSS, JavaScript and fonts to zero
 - Removing as many CSS hacks as possible and embracing Bruce Lee's philosophy of "Be water, my friend" (inspired by [Chen Hui Jing](https://www.chenhuijing.com)).

 You can see this theme in action on my website, [robin.pm](https://robin.pm).

 The name gwei derives from the Cantonese word, é¬¼ (gwai1), which roughly translates to "ghost".
