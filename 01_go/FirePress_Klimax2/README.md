## FirePress Klimax2

Our theme **FirePress Klimax2** is an enhanced version of the original [Casper 2 theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/tree/2.10.0) made by the Ghost foundation. The goal is to make a drop-in replacement of the original Casper theme.

It [follows updates](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/blob/master/package.json#L5)) has we want to keep best practice and new feature made by the original Casper theme.
