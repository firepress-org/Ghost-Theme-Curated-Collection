## FirePress Casper

FirePress Casper an enhanced version of the original Casper theme made by the Ghost foundation. We decided to make it available to everyone and open sourced here: https://github.com/firepress-org/FirePress_Casper

Our goal is to make a drop replacement of the orginal Casper theme by following updates and by not breaking anything from the original Casper.

- Table (grid)
