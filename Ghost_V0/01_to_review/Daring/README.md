# Daring

https://github.com/matthewl/Daring

Inspired by John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) link blog, Daring is a similar theme for users of Ghost. It favours text over images and doesn't handle cover images or post images in Ghost.

Daring is based on the excellent [Poole](http://getpoole.com) by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

## Usage

Daring is built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a great starting point for Jekyll but also works well when used with Ghost.
