# Arabica

A smooth, minimal [Ghost](https://ghost.org) theme.

## Installation
Move the `arabica` folder into `content/themes` in your Ghost installation. Restart Ghost and select Arabica in your Ghost settings.

## Options

### Twitter Link
`default.hbs` includes an optional Twitter link. To enable, uncomment it by removing the `{{!` and `}}` handlebars around the section and update the text and url with your Twitter handle.

### Post Excerpts
`index.hbs` and `tag.hbs` can be modified to show post excerpts instead of full posts. Change "post-full" to "post-excerpt". The length of the excerpt can be modified in `partials/post-excerpt.hbs`. The default length is 30 words.
