## Introduction

This Git repo is a curation of open-source Ghost Themes. It’s a very **opiniated** classification. The question I ask myself is: **Would I recommand this theme to a friend or a client ?** If it’s not a « Hell yes! » kind of reaction, I move the theme I’m reviewing in the [03_no-go directory](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go/tree/master/03_no-go).

This project is a **monorepo**. It means it’s an aggregation of existing projects. These Ghost themes are not developped directly within this repository and may be outdated. Look at the source to see all the action.

## Author

In the git world most people refer themselves as maintainers but I hate this expression. It feels heavy. I much prefer author.
