## What is this?

It’s a curation of open-source Ghost Themes (*a template if you prefer*) for Ghost. It’s a very **opiniated** classification. The question I ask myself is: **Would I recommand this theme to a friend or a client ?** If it’s not a « Hell yes! » kind of reaction, I move the theme I’m reviewing in the [03_no-go directory](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go/tree/master/03_no-go).

This project is a **monorepo**. It means it’s an aggregation of existing projects. These Ghost themes are not developped directly within this repository. Look at the source to see all the action. 

**What is Ghost?** — Ghost is an open source software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.


## Start here

1. The most interesting directory is: [01_go](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).


## Submodules

This is a note to myself as I always strungle to use submodules.

**To add a new theme as a submodule**:

```
git submodule add $GIT_URL
git submodule update --init --recursive
git commit
git push
```

**To update submodules from parents projects**:

```
cd 01_go && \
./update-submodules.sh && \
echo "submodules are updated"
```
