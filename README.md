## Introduction

**What is this?** Itâ€™s a curation of open-source Ghost Themes. Itâ€™s actually a very opiniated classification of ghost themes. The question I ask myself is: **Would I recommand this theme to a friend or a client ?** If itâ€™s not a Hell yes! kind of reaction, I move the theme Iâ€™m reviewing in the [03_no-go directory](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go/tree/master/03_no-go).

ðŸ™ˆ Iâ€™m aware that this README needs **more love**. Time is the biggest challenge here. Feel free to [buzz me on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy) if you have any questions or comments.
