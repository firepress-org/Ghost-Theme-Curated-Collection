## About
This is a collection of open-source theme. 

It would be nice if everything could be free. But sadly this is a public repo and we can’t put 3rd party premium themes here. At this moment, the curation of themes to buy stay private.

We made sure to make it easy for your to compare all those theme by putting some common content in them.

## The FireMeter

This is the possible review a theme can get:

- 5/5 - Our Top 10 (because the paradox of choice is real)
- 4/4 - Hell yeah _Ù/
- 3/4 - Big Potential
- 2/4 - Small Potential
- 1/4 - No Way! (Not part of the repo, but listed here)

## Why not forking the original repo?

I though about it but I wanted to maintnant ONE main collection repo so the fork was not a solution. I made sure to put a from: [source link] in each README.md of each themes

## Why not using sub-modules?

I tried this and it looks good on paper. But working with submodule is a pain and it's easy to mess up your project. Per example, I was stocked in a merge because, for some reasons, the .gitmodules produced warning. The result was that I could not fix it because git didn't allow me to change to the branch it was asking to fix ... 

Anyways, I'm still open to the idea, but only if someone with real experience with submodule want to make it work with me :)
