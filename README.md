## Introduction

Find a curation of open-source Ghost Themes. Itâ€™s a very **opiniated** classification of ghost themes. The question I ask myself is: **Would I recommand this theme to a friend or a client ?** If itâ€™s not a Hell yes! kind of reaction, I move the theme Iâ€™m reviewing in the [03_no-go directory](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go/tree/master/03_no-go).

This project is a **monorepo** (an aggregation of existing projects). It means that these Ghost themes are not developped directly within this repository and be be outdated. Look at the source to see all the action.
